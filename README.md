Our Code of Conduct applies to all participants in all of our events open to external partners and the public. We want to ensure that everyone who comes into the DSSG NYC space feels welcome, and we want to foster a safe, productive environment for fellows, staff, and visitors.

Important

Our Anti-Harassment Policy explicitly outlines the behavior for which we have a zero tolerance policy. If you feel that you or anyone else is being harassed or treated unfairly, or have any other concerns related to this policy, please contact a staff member. All contact with the staff about harassment will be confidential.

Data Science for Social Good NYC is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience in all event venues, including talks, parties, and online media, for everyone regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form.

Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, gender identity, age, race, religion, the use or display of sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. Participants asked to stop any such behavior are expected to comply immediately.

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately and may be sanctioned or expelled from the fellowship and/or all related events at the discretion of the organizers. Organizers may take any lawful action we deem appropriate, including but not limited to warning the offender or asking the offender to leave the specific event or the fellowship program as a whole.

If you feel anyone has violated this policy, please bring it up directly with the individual or with a DSSG-NYC staff member.
