# Data Diplomats for Nonprofits Onboarding

Welcome to the Spring 2026 Cohort!

Data Diplomats are first and foremost community organizers, leaders, and strategists who understand how AI and data will change the world. We amplify nonprofits' mission by using AI & Data Science for Social Good while adopting a set of cultural values and ethical conduct into our civic technology tech framework.
